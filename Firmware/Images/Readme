Here is a list of all firmware available for the ducky-key.

- c_duck_v2.1.hex:
Allow the device to work as both a HID and standard storage device at the same time. 

- usb.hex:
FAT Duck.

- duck.hex:
Original firmware.

- duck_v2.1.hex
Same as duck.hex
BOOT allows the Ducky to work from boot: BIOS, EFI, Firmware

- m_duck.hex:
Multi-payloads
inject.bin - default; ducky will always run this on insertion into a computer,
Enable NUMLOCK (inject2.bin) or enable CAPSLOCK (inject3.bin)
Then push the reset switch on the naked duck, to trigger the 2nd/3rd payload.

- m_duck_v2.hex
Same as m_duck.hex 
No longer have to press the GPIO button
Inject4.bin = Scroll_Lock <- New Trigger Key

- USB_v2.hex | duck_v2.hex:
Idem as usb.hex and duck.hex but VID and PID control is now easier 
-> create vidpid.bin on the root of the sdcard
Use a hexeditor to write the first 2x bytes for the VID, followed by another 2x bytes for the PID
